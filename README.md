# Carlson MSBA Projects

Thanks for stopping by! This is a repository of some of my favorite work from this past year in the Carlson School of Management's Master of Science in Business Analytics program. Below is a summarization of each folder to help navigate the repository so you can find the work that is of particular interest to you.


## association_rules
  - The objective was to leverage association rules to identify novel ways the coach of AS Roma (Italian Soccer Team) could refine in-game strategy or scouting practices to improve the team's performance in forthcoming seasons. 7 player attributes were found to be statistically indicative of success, thus the coach would be well served to prioritize these skills in future scouting efforts.
  
## clustering
  - airline_travelers contains the application of k-Mediods clustering to identify a unique group of flyers that are particularly susceptible to joining the airline's loyalty program. 500 customer id's were found to be ideal candidates for the airline's next targeted promotional campaign.
  - coffee_shop_customers applied k-Means clustering to find a group of customers who would likely participate in a new product offering that would help address diminishing revenue and stabalize demand for the coffee shop throughout the day/week.

## nlp
  - I found the use case of this project to be especially unique. I recommend downloading voice_thread.mov and watching the short video to see how my team performed Natural Language Processing on the Google Trends API and Twitter API to increase Andrew Yang's chances of winning the 2020 presidential election. The technical details can be found in the jupyter notebooks.

## predictive modeling
  - customer_forecasting contains an end-to-end predictive modeling project utilizing sklearn and keras to help a holding company predict how many customers they should expect to visit their restaurants over the next 5 weeks. A Light Gradient Boosting Regression Tree, capitalizing on several engineered features, was able to improve the mean absolute error of the client's baseline regression model by 27%. I specifically developed notebooks 5 (feature engineering), 6 (static modeling & prep), and 9 (plots for deliverables). 
  - employee_contribution was a multivariate regression analysis aiming to identify which aspects of an applicant's background relate to an impactful career at the firm (in this case IBM). This project focused more on the statistical assumptions of regression and the interpretation of results rather than final model predictive accuracy.
  - spam_classification was a rigorous modeling exercise to generate evidence as to which type of predictive model is best suited for the dataset in terms of overall prediction accuracy and missclassification cost.
